            In our profession, the term “advisory services” is often employed, yet there is a lack of consensus regarding its precise definition. When queried about the advisory services they provide, multi-service firms offer a diverse array of responses that frequently overlap with traditional compliance services.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) defines advisory services as those in which the practitioner “develops findings, conclusions, and recommendations for client consideration and decision-making.” The AICPA further delineates examples of advisory services to include “an operational review and improvement study, analysis of an accounting system, assistance with strategic planning, and definition of requirements for an information system.” Although this definition is beneficial, it appears more formal and restrictive than the descriptions of advisory services typically provided by practitioners in their respective firms.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            During a recent Intuit® Tax Council roundtable, firm owners characterized advisory services as “addressing client challenges and applying strategies to create opportunities that foster growth.” This definition is more oriented towards outcomes compared to the AICPA definition and remains consistent with the AICPA’s recommendations for client consideration and decision-making.

            Compliance and advisory services are interrelated, with advisory services necessitating a foundation of current, accurate financial records to provide actionable insights. While the suite of compliance services tends to be uniform across firms, the provision of advisory services is often customized for each firm. Due to the absence of a clear delineation between these services, some firms end up offering advisory services while only being compensated for compliance tasks.
